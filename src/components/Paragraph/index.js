        <h3 className="aboutMe">Hello, my name is Dawson Hamilton and I am a full stack Web Developer. My skills include a variety
        of coding languages but i have found myself to really enjoy front end languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQueary, React.js...
        One of the things that I think learning about computer programming has tought me a lot about is how to work really well in
        a team environment. I have also learned  alot about the processes of reasearching the answer to questions that I may have about
        problems with my code. One my free time I really love to do really anything with computers whether that is coding, watching
        youtube videos, playing video games, or even building computers themselves! Looking to really put myself out there and learn
        the most that I can about computer programming. </h3>
