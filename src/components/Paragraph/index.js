        <h3 className="aboutMe">Hello, my name is Dawson Hamilton and I am a full stack Web Developer. My skills include a variety
        of coding languages but i have found myself to really enjoy front end languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQueary, React.js...
        One of the things that computer programming has tought me a lot about is how to work really well in a team environment which I
        feel is very important as I make my way into the job force. I have also learned  alot about the processes of reasearching the
        answer to questions that I may have about problems with my code. I have also learned what it is like to work in a fast paced
        environment which I feel like is a good skill to aquire. On my free time I really love to do really anything with computers
        whether that is coding, watching youtube videos, playing video games, or even building computers themselves! Looking to really
        put myself out there and learn the most that I can about computer programming. </h3>
